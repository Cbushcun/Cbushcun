# Hello — welcome to my GitHub

Thank you for taking the time to look through my repo. I assume that if you are seeing this, you’ve been directed here from my resume. This repo contains projects that I am currently working on, projects I have completed for my Bachelors, and other code snippets I would like to work on or keep track of.

## About Me

I built my first gaming computer in 2014 and since then have had an interest in learning about technology in my courses. from 3D modeling and graphic design in high school to networking and software development in college. I obtained most of my software development knowledge primarily through the following courses in college: Programming & Problem Solving I & II (Lecture & Lab), Discreet Math, Probability & Data Analysis, Introduction to Web Development, Databases & Advanced Databases, and my IT Capsone Course. I obtained my Bachelors in Information Technology in May 2024 and would love to immerse myself professionally in technology. Until then, I enjoy working on side projects and learning new things about networking and programming through home server hosting or developing practical applications.

## Featured Projects

Below are a few projects that reflect the type of work I aim to produce. Each one ~~has~~ ***will have*** its own README with more detail (*currently in the progress of touching up my github to be more organized*).

### **Project 1: User Authentication & Profile Management**
[Repo](https://github.com/Cbushcun/login-templates)

I am currently working on this project to deepen my knowledge of what goes into logging in users without an authentication provider. This project focuses on user/session creation and manipulation. Currently, a user can register and log in. Once logged in, their sessions expire every 15 minutes and are refreshed through database JWT validation, extending it up to 7 days. I am currently working on implementing the mongoose driver into a database object so that I can easily use a single database connection on the server to read and write data. This change comes from a desire to focus on OOP principles and organize my code through minimizing the amount of floading functions in my /lib directory files. There is currently no live site to view but I will be working on that in the coming days/weeks.

* Built with: NextJS, MongoDB

### **Project 2: IT Capstone Auction Website**
[Presentation Site](https://clayson1.wixsite.com/capstoneproject)

[Repo](https://github.com/Cbushcun/IT-Capstone-Project)

This project was primarily a research project to investigate the capabilities of AI when developing web applications. This was accomplished over 3 major milestones where we researched what goes into auction websites and experimented with emerging AI technologies to develop a prototype complete with database I/O and session handling (circa fall 2023). Through this project, we researched, documented, and presented all of our findings and conclusions over a 3 month period and presented the findings to our peers and the staff of the university. Due to losing access to my univeristy email and therefore my Azure account, there is no live presentation of this application currently.

* Built with: SQLite, Flask, Azure

### **Project 3: Intro to Web Development Portfolio**
[Demo Site](https://cbushcun.github.io/Intro-to-Web-Development-website/)
[Repo](https://github.com/Cbushcun/Intro-to-Web-Development-website)

This was the portfolio I made over the period of my Intro to Web Development course using static webpages. I plan to revisit this project to enhance the UI/UX experience and deepen my knowledge of HTML ARIA attributes. 

* Built with: HTML, CSS

## What I’m Working On

I’m currently exploring:

* User authentication flow and how to securely handle user login sessions.
* The benefits of authentication providors and how their incorporation differs from handcrafting authentication flows.
